# VineRobot_TCNJ

This project uses a mix of Computer Vision and Artificial Inelligence to design a Vine Robot with a camera - which can detect people trapped in ruins or debris.
 - This project will help Emergency Services in knowing the exact location of the trapped people and hence, can design a strategy to get them out as quickly and safely as possible.
